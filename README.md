# Overview
This application is designed for users to connect with an overnight cat sitter or to provide cat-sitting services to other users. The logic and data are managed by a REST API, with an independent Angular SPA frontend. A user can view host units to choose where their cat will stay, and can book, rate, or comment on a stay. Hosts can review their ratings and comments, and edit thier postings.
